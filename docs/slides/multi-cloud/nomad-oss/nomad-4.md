# Nomad Jobs
* We've already discussed **Nomad Jobs** in Chapter 2 and have already run a simple job in our first lab.
* But what exactly is a Nomad Job?
  * A specification provided by a user that declares  a workload for Nomad.
  * A form of **desired state** for that workload.
  * The actual workload executed by the job.
* Nomad decides where the job should run and makes sure that the **actual state** matches the user's desired state.
* Jobs are composed of one or more task groups which contain tasks.

???
* Define Jobs again to make sure we're all on the same page.

name: Nomad Job and Scheduler Types
class: col-2, smaller
# Nomad Job and Scheduler Types
- The [type stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/job.html#type) specifies the Nomad scheduler to use.
- Nomad has three scheduler types that can be used when creating your job:
  - `service`
  - `system`
  - `batch`

<br>

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
* type = "system"
}
```
???
* There are 3 types of Nomad jobs, corresponding to the three types of Nomad schedulers

---
name: Service Scheduler
# Service Scheduler
- The [Service Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#service) is designed for scheduling long lived services that should never go down
- Service jobs are intended to run until explicitly stopped by an operator.
- If a service task exits it is considered a failure and handled according to the job's `restart` and `reschedule` stanzas.

???
* First, we have the Service Scheduler

---
name: Batch Scheduler
# Batch Scheduler
  - The [Batch Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#batch) runs batch jobs, which are short lived, usually finishing in a few minutes to a few days.
  - They are much less sensitive to short term performance fluctuations.
  - Batch jobs are intended to run until they exit successfully.
  - Batch tasks that exit with an error are handled according to the job's `restart` and `reschedule` stanzas.

???
* Then, we have the Batch Scheduler

---
name: System Scheduler
class: smaller
# System Scheduler
- The [System Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#system) registers jobs that should run on all clients that meet constraints.
- It is also invoked when clients join the cluster or transition into the ready state.
  - This means that all registered system jobs will be re-evaluated and their tasks will be placed on the newly available nodes if the constraints are met.
- Systems jobs are intended to run until explicitly stopped either by an operator or by preemption.
- If a system task exits it is considered a failure and handled according to the job's `restart` stanza.
- System jobs do not have rescheduling.

???
* And last we have the System Scheduler.

# Declaring Jobs and Their Target Datacenters

.smaller[
- [Nomad Jobs](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification) are the primary configuration that users interact with when using Nomad.
- Nomad models infrastructure as regions and datacenters.
- Regions may contain multiple datacenters.
- Servers are assigned to a specific region, managing state and making scheduling decisions within that region.
]

```hcl

*job "example" {
* datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

???
* Simple redis job definition
---
name: Declaring Task Groups
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Task Groups

.smaller[
- The [group stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/group.html) defines a series of tasks that should be co-located on the same Nomad client.
- Any task within a group will be placed on the same client.
- But note that multiple instances of a task group can be placed.
]
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
*  group "cache" {
*    task "redis" {
*     driver = "docker"
*    }
*    task "web" {
*     driver = "docker"

name: Declaring Tasks
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Tasks
.smaller[
- The [task stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/task.html) creates an individual unit of work, such as a Docker container, web application, or batch processing.
- Tasks can be short-lived batch jobs or long-running services such as a web application, database server, or API.
]
<br>
```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
   group "cache" {
*    task "redis" {
*      driver = "docker"
*      config {

name: Declaring Task Drivers
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Task Drivers
.smaller[
-   [Task Drivers](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers) are used by Nomad clients to execute a task and provide resource isolation.
-  Task driver resource isolation is intended to provide separation of Nomad client CPU, memory, and storage between tasks.
-  Resource isolation effectiveness is dependent upon individual task driver implementations and underlying operating systems.
]
<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
   group "cache" {
     task "redis" {
*     driver = "docker"

### HashiCorp Task Drivers
.smaller[
- There are 5 task drivers developed and maintained by HashiCorp:
  - [Docker Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html)
  - [Raw Fork/Exec Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/raw_exec.html)

  - [Java Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/java.html)
  - [QEMU Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/qemu.html)
  - [Podman Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/podman)
<br>
<br>

###  Community Task Drivers
- There are currently 7 open source community supported task drivers:
  - [LXC Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/lxc/)
  - [Singularity Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/singularity/)
  - [Jail Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/jail-task-driver/)
  - [Pot Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/pot/)
  - [Firecracker Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/firecracker-task-driver/)

name: Docker Task Driver
class: compact, col-2
# Docker Task Driver
.smaller[
- The [Docker Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html) (`docker`) manages and runs Docker containers.
- The most important (and only required) configuration setting is `image`, which specifies the Docker image to use.
- There are many other settings, most of which correspond to arguments that can be passed to the `docker run` command.
- The `docker` driver can map ports from the host network into the containers.
]

<br>


```hcl

task "redis" {
  driver = "docker"
    config {
      image = "redis:3.2"
      port_map {
        db = 6379
      }
    }
  }    
}
```

???
* The Docker Driver runs Docker containers from Docker images.
It can map ports.
* It has a lot of configuration options

---
name: Raw Fork/Exec Driver
class: compact, col-2
# Raw Fork/Exec Driver
.smaller[
- The [Raw Fork/Exec Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/raw_exec.html) (`raw_exec`) is used to execute a command without any isolation.
- The task is started as the same user as the Nomad process.
- **It therefore should be used with extreme care and is disabled by default for security reasons.**
- It can be enabled with in the Nomad client configuration in the `plugin` stanza.
]


```hcl

task "example" {
  driver = "raw_exec"
  config {
    command = "/bin/sleep"
    args    = ["1"]
  }
}
```

???
* The Raw Fork/Exec Driver can run scripts.
* But it is somewhat dangerous.

---
name: Isolated Fork/Exec Driver
class: compact, col-2
# Isolated Fork/Exec Driver
.smaller[
- The [Isolated Fork/Exec Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/exec.html) (`exec`) is used to execute a particular command.
- However, unlike the `raw_exec` driver, the `exec` driver users the underlying isolation primitives of the operating system to limit the task's access to resources.
- This makes it **much safer** than the `raw_exec` driver.
- It can be used to call scripts or other wrappers that provide higher level features.
]
<br>

```hcl
task "example" {
  driver = "exec"
  config {
    command = "/bin/sleep"
    args    = ["1"]
  }
}
```

???
* The Isolated Fork/Exec Driver also runs scripts.
* But it is much safer.

---
name: Java Driver
class: compact, col-2
# Java Driver
.smaller[
- The [Java Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/java.html) (`java`) is used to execute Java applications packaged Java Jar files.
- It requires the Jar file to be accessible from the Nomad client via the [artifact downloader](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/artifact.html).
- The Java application run by the driver can be configured with the `args`, `class`, `class_path`, `jar_path`, and `jvm_options` settings.
]
<br>
<br>
<br>

```hcl

task "web" {
  driver = "java"
  config {
    jar_path    = "local/hello.jar"
    jvm_options = ["-Xmx2048m", "-Xms256m"]
  }
  artifact {
    source = "https://FQDN/hello.jar"
  }
}
```

???
* The Java Driver lets you launch Java applications from Jar files.
* You can even download them with the Nomad's artifact downloader.

---
name: Qemu Driver
class: compact, col-2
# Qemu Driver
.smaller[
* The [Qemu Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/qemu.html) (`qemu`) provides a generic virtual machine runner for QEMU.
* It can map a set of ports from the host machine to the guest virtual machine and provide configuration for resource allocation.
* The qemu driver can execute any regular QEMU image (e.g. qcow, img, iso), and is invoked with qemu-system-x86_64.
* The driver requires the image to be accessible from the Nomad client via the artifact downloader.
]

<br>

```hcl

task "virtual" {
  driver = "qemu"
  config {
    image_path  = "local/linux.img"
    accelerator = "kvm"
    graceful_shutdown = true
    args        = ["-nodefaults"]
  }
  artifact {
    source = "https://FQDN/linux.img"
  }
}
```

???
* wait, so you are telling me that Nomad can just run vm images all willy nilly?

name: Specifying Required Resources
class: compact, col-2
# Specifying Required Resources
- The [resources stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/resources.html) describes the requirements a task requires.
  - Resource requirements include memory, CPU, and device.
  - Tasks will only be scheduled to client nodes that satisfy its resource requirements.

<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  group "cache"
  {
    task "redis" {
*     resources {
*       cpu    = 500
*       memory = 256
*     }
    }

name: Specifying Networking
class: compact, col-2
# Specifying Networking
- The [network stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html) specifies the networking requirements for all tasks in the task group.
  - Bandwidth
  - Port Allocations

<br>
<br>

```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
*   network {
*     mbits = 100
*     port  "db"  {}
* }

# Specifying Port Mapping
.smaller[
- Nomad supports [Dynamic Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#dynamic-ports), [Static Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#static-ports), and [Mapped Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#mapped-ports).

* In this example, Redis is listening on port 6379 inside the Docker container.
* Nomad will dynamically select a port and map requests sent to it to port 6379 inside the container.

# Registering Tasks as Consul Services
.smaller[
- The [service stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service.html) instructs Nomad to register the service with Consul for Service Discovery.
- We can define tags, health checks, ports, and several other [parameters](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service.html#service-parameters).
