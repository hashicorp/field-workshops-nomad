# The Shift to Containers
.center[![:scale 70%](images/Nomad_Business_Value.png)]

???
*  Lowers total cost of ownership (TCO) via bin packing
*  Runs both containerized and legacy apps (e.g. Java classes and jars)
*  Easy to operate and maintain

???
* Companies are embracing containers, but still need to run legacy applications.
* Nomad supports both.

# Nomad's Business Value
* Increase Hardware Utilization.
  * Increase density of running applications through bin-packing.
* Reduce Operational Overhead.
 * Empower developers to self-service their own applications with less or no assistance from operators.
* Accelerate Time To Market.
  * Run containers and legacy applications together with the same workflow on the same infrastructure.

???
*  Let's discuss the business benefits of Nomad.

name:  chapter1-what-is-nomad
# What is Nomad?
* A flexible, lightweight, high performing, easy to use orchestrator
* Used to deploy and manage containers and legacy applications simultaneously
* Works across data centers and cloud platforms, providing universal scheduling
* Manages services, batch functions, as well as global system services

???
* Nomad runs as a single binary in just about any environment * one of the easiest and lightweight service scheduler and manager available.
*  Used to deploy both container applications, as well as legacy applications such as Java or raw executables.
*  As an independent function, Nomad can run and communicate across data centers, and cloud platforms.  Truly cloud agnostic.
*  Can manage individual services, batch functions, or even global system services such as monitoring functions.

name: chapter-1-nomad-autoscaling
class: compact
# Nomad Autoscaling
* Nomad supports two types of autoscaling:
  * **Horizontal Application Autoscaling** allows the counts of task groups to dynamically scale up and back down.
  * **Horizontal Cluster Autoscaling** allows the size of a Nomad cluster to dynamically scale out and back in.
* The latter is currently only supported in AWS using Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).
* Both types of autoscaling are driven by APM metrics.
* The Nomad Autoscaler agent can be deployed as a Nomad job.

# Nomad Enterprise Platform Features
* All Open Source Features
* Automated Upgrades with Autopilot
* Automated Backups with Snapshot Agent
* Enhanced Read Scalability
* Redundancy Zones
* Multiple Vault Namespaces

???
* All Open Source Features are included in Enterprise
* Autopilot Upgrades
* Automated backups with Nomad's Snapshot agent
* Servers can act as a non-voting member of the cluster to help provide read scalability
* Nomad attempts to parition servers according to specified redundancy zone, and will aim to keep one voting server per zone
* A single Nomad cluster can access multiple namespaces of a Vault cluster.

# Nomad Enterprise Modules
* Nomad Enterprise Governance & Policy Module
  * Namespaces
  * Resource Quotas
  * Sentinel Policies
  * Cross-Namespace Queries
  * Audit Logging
* Nomad Multi-Cluster & Efficiency Module
  * Multi-Region Job Deployments

???
* A shared cluster can be partitioned into multiple namespaces which allow jobs and their associated objects to be isolated from each other and other users of the cluster
* Resource quotas limit resource consumption across teams or projects to reduce waste and align budgets
* Sentinel defines policies such as disallowing jobs to be submitted to production on Fridays or only allowing users to run jobs that use pre-authorized Docker images
* Cross-Namespace Queries allow the Nomad HTTP API and CLI to retrieve data from multiple namespaces.
* Audit Logging allows enterprises to proactively identify access anomalies.
* Multi-region Deployments can deploy allocations across multiple Nomad clusters/regions and roll back if deployments fail in remote clusters.
