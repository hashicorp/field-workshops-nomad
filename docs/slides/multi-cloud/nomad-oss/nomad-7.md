# Chapter 7 Topics

* Using the Nomad CLI to:
  * Inspect Jobs, Allocations, and Evaluations
  * View Allocation Logs
* Using the Nomad UI to do the same
* Hands on Lab: Nomad Monitoring

???
* In this chapter, we'll discuss how to monitor Nomad jobs including their allocations, evaluations, task groups, and tasks.
* The hands-on lab will show how Nomad telemetry can be sent to tools like Prometheus.

# Inspect a Job

To inspect the status of the job with the Nomad CLI, run:<br>
`nomad job status <job_id>`<br>
```output
*nomad job status redis
 ID            = redis
 Name          = redis
 Type          = service
 Status        = running
 ...
Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created  Modified
*081459da  234c769f  cache       0        run      running  2m ago   2m ago
```
The output here is abbreviated but shows the ID of a running allocation, which can then be inspected.
???
* This is the command to inspect the status of a job.

name: inspect-allocation
class: compact, smaller
# Inspect an Allocation
To inspect an allocation with the Nomad CLI, run:<br>
`nomad alloc status <allocation_id>` <br>
```output
*nomad alloc status 081459da
*ID                  = 081459da
Eval ID             = 13ebb66d
Name                = redis.cache[0]
*Node ID             = 234c769f
*Node Name           = nomad-client-1
Job ID              = redis
```
Note that we used the *Allocation ID* from the output of the job status command and can see which node the allocation is running on.<br>
We also see the ID of the evaluation that scheduled the allocation.

???
* This is the command to inspect the status of an allocation.

# Inspect an Evaluation
To inspect an evaluation with the Nomad CLI, run: <br>
`nomad eval status <evaluation_id>` <br>
```output
*nomad eval status 13ebb66d
ID                 = 13ebb66d
Create Time        = 1m27s ago
Status             = complete
Type               = service
Job ID             = redis
Priority           = 50
*Placement Failures = false
```
Note that we used the *Eval ID* from the output of the allocation status command.<br>
We also can verify that there were no placement failures.

???
* This is the command to inspect the status of an allocation.

# View Task Logs
To view the logs for a task with the Nomad CLI, run: <br>
`nomad alloc logs <allocation_id> <task>` <br>
```output
*nomad alloc logs 081459da redis
1:C 10 Jan 16:05:30.456 # Warning: no config file specified, using the default config. In order to specify a config file use redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

```
Note that we again used the *Allocation ID* from the output of the job status command.

???
* This is the command to view logs for a task.

# Monitoring Nomad with the Nomad UI
* The following slides show how the Nomad UI can be used to monitor:
  * Jobs
  * Allocations
  * Task Groups
  * Tasks (including their logs)

???
* The Nomad UI can also be used to monitor Nomad

# Monitoring Nomad With Prometheus
* The Nomad client and server agents collect runtime [telemetry](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/telemetry/index.html).
* Operators can use this data to gain real-time visibility into their Nomad clusters and improve performance.
* The metrics can be exported to tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Graphite, DataDog, and Circonus.

???
* Nomad collects telemetry that can be sent to external tools like Prometheus.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Monitoring Nomad With Prometheus Lab
* This track will guide you through implementing the [Using Prometheus to Monitor Nomad Metrics](https://www.nomadproject.io/guides/operations/monitoring-and-alerting/prometheus-metrics.html) guide.
* In the lab, you will do the following with Nomad:
  * Deploy [Fabio](https://fabiolb.net) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview) to a Nomad cluster.
  * Deploy the Prometheus [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager) to the cluster
  * Deploy a web server to the Nomad cluster, stop it, and see alerts generated in Prometheus and Alertmanager.
* You'll do all this in the [Nomad Monitoring](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/f7v0fg7ewyzu) Instruqt track.

???
* Now, you can explore collecting metrics from Nomad into Prometheus hands-on.
