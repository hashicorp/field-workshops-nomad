# Where are We and Where are We Going?

* We already learned about Nomad servers, clients, clusters, and jobs in Chapter 2.
* We even ran a Nomad Dev Agent and a simple job in the "Nomad Basics" lab.
* But we did not have to do any configuration of that agent.  
* In this chapter, we will learn how to configure and run Nomad servers and clients and how to connect them in clusters.
* We'll also learn how to modify and re-run Nomad jobs.

???
* We've learned a little about Nomad servers, clients, clusters, and jobs.
* But there is more.
* In particular, we want to learn how to configure Nomad servers and clients and cluster them.
* We also want to learn how to modify and re-run jobs.

# Review of Nomad Clusters, Servers, and Clients
* Nomad organizes infrastructure into **Datacenters** within **Regions**.
* Each Nomad Region always runs a single Nomad **Cluster** even if it has multiple Datacenters.
* Nomad **Servers** are the brains of a Nomad Cluster.
* They manage all jobs and clients in the region, run evaluations, create task allocations, assign these allocations along with their task groups to clients, and replicate state between each other.
  * Nomad Servers run the Nomad agent with `server.enabled` set to `true` in their configuration files or are started with the `-server` CLI argument.
* Nomad **Clients** run the task groups and tasks of Nomad jobs assigned to them by servers.
  * Nomad Clients run the Nomad agent with `client.enabled` set to `true` in their configuration files or are started with the `-client` CLI argument.

???
* Let's review what Nomad clusters, servers, and clients are and how they differ.
* First, we need to understand that servers and clients are organized into datacenters and regions with one cluster per region.
* Whether a Nomad agent (and the machine) it runs on is a Nomad server or client depends on how it is configured or on the CLI arguments used to start it.

# Nomad Server Configuration
Here is a typical Nomad Server configuration:

```hcl
server {
  enabled = true
  bootstrap_expect = 3
  server_join {
    retry_join = ["nomad-server-1"]
  }
}
```

`enabled = true` specifies that the agent should run as a server.<br>
`bootstrap_expect = 3` specifies the number of server nodes to wait for before leader election.
`retry_join` indicates which other server or servers to connect to.

???
* This slide shows the key portion of a Nomad HCL configuration file that makes an agent run as a server.
* It also shows the important `bootstrap_expect` setting that determines how many servers should the cluster should run before any server tries to become a leader.
* It also shows the `retry_join` setting that tells the server what other server or servers to cluster with.

# Nomad Client Configuration
Here is a typical Nomad Client configuration:

```hcl
client {
  enabled = true
  servers = ["nomad-server-1"]
}
```

`enabled` specifies that the agent should run as a client.<br>
`servers` indicates which server or servers to connect to.

???
* This slide shows the key portion of a Nomad HCL configuration file that makes an agent run as a client.
* It also shows the `servers` setting that tells the client what server or servers to connect to.

# Job Specification

* A **Job Specification** is given by an HCL file that defines the workloads that the job should run.
* We'll learn more about job specifications in Chapter 5.
* Here is part of the job specification you will create in this chapter's lab:

```hcl
job "redis" {
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "redis:3.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
???
* This slide shows part of the job specification you will create in this chapter's lab.
* We see that it will run a Redis Docker container.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Lab 5: Nomad Simple Cluster
* Now, you'll have a chance to configure and run your first Nomad cluster.
* You'll run a simple Nomad cluster consisting of 1 server and 2 clients in the [Nomad Simple Cluster](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/vcqexnx8ency) Instruqt track.
* In the first challenge, you will configure and run the cluster.
* In additional challenges, you will create, run, stop, modify, and then re-run a simple job in the cluster.
* Start the "Nomad Simple Cluster" track by clicking on the "Run the Nomad Server and 2 Clients" challenge of the track.

???
* Now, you'll do the second lab of the workshop in which you'll run a simple Nomad cluster with 1 server and 2 clients.
* You'll also create, run, stop, modify, and then re-run a simple job in the cluster.
* We'll be running the Instruqt track "Nomad Simple Cluster"

# Nomad Commands Used in the Lab (1)
* Run a Nomad agent as a server or client:
  * `nomad agent -config <config_file>`
* List the servers in the cluster:
  * `nomad server members`
* List the clients in the cluster:
  * `nomad node status`
* Initialize a new sample Nomad job:
  * `nomad job init -short`
* Plan a Nomad job (to do a dry run):
  * `nomad job plan <jobspec>`
* Run a Nomad job:
  * `nomad job run <jobspec>`

???
* This slide shows some of the Nomad commands you will use in the lab.

# Nomad Commands Used in the Lab (2)
* Get the status of a specific Nomad job:
  * `nomad job status <ID>`
* Get the status of a Nomad evaluation:
  * `nomad eval status <EvaluationID>`
* Get the status of a Nomad allocation:
  * `nomad alloc status <AllocationID>`
* Get the logs of a task from a Nomad allocation:
  * `nomad alloc logs <AllocationID> <task>`
* Stop a Nomad job:

???
* This slide shows more Nomad commands you will use in the lab.
