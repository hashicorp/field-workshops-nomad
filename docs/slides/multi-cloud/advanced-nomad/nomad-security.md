# Nomad Encryption Overview

There are two separate encryption systems for Nomad:
* Gossip Traffic Encryption.
* HTTP and RPC Encryption.

Together, these encrypt all of Nomad's network traffic.

???

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-encryption-gossip-1
# Gossip Traffic Encryption

.smaller[Gossip encryption is enabled by providing an encryption key when starting all servers in a region with the `-encrypt` parameter or storing the key in each server's configuration file.

The key must be 16 bytes and base64 encoded. Generate a key using the `nomad operator keygen` command.]

```bash
$ nomad operator keygen

name: nomad-chapter-security-encryption-http-rpc-1
# HTTP and RPC Encryption with TLS

.smaller[* Nomad uses mTLS (mutual TLS) to verify the authenticity of servers and clients.
* All servers and clients should have signed key pairs configured.
* Server authenticity can be enforced using:
 * `verify_server_hostname = true` in the **tls** configuration stanza.
* All servers must have a valid certificate for:
   * `server.<region>.nomad`.
   * `localhost` ( for the local cli to validate the name).
 * TLS is used to secure the RPC calls between agents.

# Benefits of Nomad mTLS

.small[
Nomad's use of mTLS provides the following benefits:
* Prevents unauthorized Nomad access
* Prevents observing or tampering with Nomad communication
* Prevents client/server role or region misconfigurations
* Prevents other services from masquerading as Nomad agents
]

???

Preventing region misconfigurations is a property of Nomad's mTLS not commonly found in the TLS implementations on the public Internet. While most uses of TLS verify the identity of the server you are connecting to based on a domain name such as example.com, Nomad verifies the node you are connecting to is in the expected region and configured for the expected role (e.g. client.us-west.nomad). This also prevents other services who may have access to certificates signed by the same private CA from masquerading as Nomad agents. If certificates were identified based on hostname/IP then any other service on a host could masquerade as a Nomad agent.

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-TLS-certificates-1
# Certificate Requirements

* Certificates must be signed by a **Private** CA.
* All certificates must be signed by the same CA.

???

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-TLS-certificates-4
class: col-2
# TLS Configuration

Adding TLS configuration to the server and client configurations:
* Copy the CA, Certificate and keyfile to the server.
* Edit the config hcl file and add the `tls` block.

<br>
```json

tls {
  http = true
  rpc  = true

  ca_file   = "nomad-ca.pem"
  cert_file = "server.pem"
  key_file  = "server-key.pem"

  verify_server_hostname = true
  verify_https_client    = true
}
```

# Access Control List (ACL) Overview

.small[
Nomad provides an optional Access Control List (ACL) system.
* Controls access to data and APIs.
* Capability-based
* Relies on tokens associated with policies
* Similar to the design of AWS IAM.

The ACL system is designed to be:
* Easy to use
* Fast to enforce
* Provide administrative insight.

# ACL Policies

.small[
An ACL policy is a named set of rules.

Each policy must have:
* A unique name
* A rule set.
* A description (Optional)
]
<br>
<br>

.smaller[
```json
{
  "Name": "anonymous",
  "Description": "Allow RO",
  "Rules": "
    namespace \"default\" {
        policy = \"read\"
    }
    agent {
        policy = \"read\"
    }
    node {
        policy = \"read\"
    }"
}
```
]

---

class: col-2
# ACL Policies

.small[
* Default = Deny-All.
* No permissions by default.
* Policies allow a set of capabilities or actions.
]

.small[
* For Example: a "readonly" policy might only grant the ability to list and inspect running jobs, but not to submit new ones.
]
???

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-ACL-policies-3
# ACL Policies
.small[
* A special `anonymous` policy can be defined for **anonymous** requests.
  * Defines capabilities for **anonymous** requests.
  * By default there is no `anonymous` policy

* An anonymous request is a request made to Nomad without the `X-Nomad-Token` header specified.

* The Nomad UI uses the anonymous policy unless an ACL is set for it.

]

???
The special `anonymous` policy can be defined to grant capabilities to requests which are made anonymously. An anonymous request is a request made to Nomad without the `X-Nomad-Token` header specified. This can be used to allow anonymous users to list jobs and view their status, while requiring authenticated requests to submit new jobs or modify existing jobs. By default, there is no `anonymous` policy set meaning all anonymous requests are denied.

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-ACL-tokens-0
# ACL Tokens
.small[
## Standard Tokens
* A client ACL token can be associated with multiple policies.
* A request is allowed if any of the associated policies grant the capability.

## Management tokens
* Cannot be associated with policies.
* They are granted all capabilities.
]
???

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-ACL-tokens-1
# ACL Tokens

* ACLs perform the following roles:
  * Authenticate Requests
  * Authorize Actions
* Each ACL token contains these items:
  * Accessor ID
  * Secret ID
  * Name (Optional)

???
ACL tokens are used to authenticate requests and determine if the caller is authorized to perform an action. Each ACL token has a public Accessor ID which is used to identify the token, a Secret ID which is used to make requests to Nomad, and an optional human readable name. All client type tokens are associated with one or more policies, and can perform an action if any associated policy allows it. Tokens can be associated with policies which do not exist, which are the equivalent of granting no capabilities. The management type tokens cannot be associated with policies, but can perform any action.

---

# ACL Tokens
## Example Token
```json
{
    "Name": "Readonly token",
    "Type": "client",
    "Policies": ["readonly"],
    "Global": false
}
```
???
When ACL tokens are created, they can be optionally marked as Global. This causes them to be created in the authoritative region and replicated to all other regions. Otherwise, tokens are created locally in the region the request was made and not replicated. Local tokens cannot be used for cross-region requests since they are not replicated between regions.

---
name: nomad-chapter-security-ACL-tokens-3
# ACL Tokens
* Tokens are created locally by default.
  * They are not replicated to other regions.
* If `"Global": True` is set:
  * They are created in the authoritative region.
  * They are replicated to **all** other regions.
* Local tokens cannot make cross-region requests.

# ACL Capabilities

* ACL Capabilities are the set of actions that can be performed on a Nomad cluster.
  * List Jobs
  * Submit Jobs
  * Query Nodes

Policy | Scope
------- | -------------------
namespace | Job related operations by namespace
agent | Utility operations in the Agent API
node | Node-level catalog operations
operator | Cluster-level operations in the Operator API
quota | Quota specification related operations

name: nomad-chapter-security-ACL-multi-region-configuration-1
# Multi-Region Configuration.
.small[
Nomad supports multi-datacenter and multi-region configurations.
* Single-Region, Multi-datacenter Configuration.
  * Servers in the region replicate state.
* Multi-Region Configuration
  * One set of servers for each region.
  * Regions operate independantly.
  * Regions are loosely coupled.

]
???
Nomad supports multi-datacenter and multi-region configurations. A single region is able to service multiple datacenters, and all servers in a region replicate their state between each other. In a multi-region configuration, there is a set of servers per region. Each region operates independently and is loosely coupled to allow jobs to be scheduled in any region and requests to flow transparently to the correct region.

When ACLs are enabled, Nomad depends on an "authoritative region" to act as a single source of truth for ACL policies and global ACL tokens. The authoritative region is configured in the server stanza of agents, and all regions must share a single authoritative source. Any ACL policies or global ACL tokens are created in the authoritative region first. All other regions replicate ACL policies and global ACL tokens to act as local mirrors. This allows policies to be administered centrally, and for enforcement to be local to each region for low latency.

Global ACL tokens are used to allow cross region requests. Standard ACL tokens are created in a single target region and not replicated. This means if a request takes place between regions, global tokens must be used so that both regions will have the token registered.
