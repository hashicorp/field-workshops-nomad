# Lab Environment Used
* This workshop uses [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com) for hands-on labs.
* Instruqt labs are run in "tracks" that are divided into "challenges".
* Here are some of the tracks you will use:
  * [Nomad Advanced Job Placement](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/rbexlxuhgqgd)
  * [Nomad Job Update Strategies](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/1a910sszvvpe)
  * [Nomad Multi-Region Federation](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/dgpya4wz0c2z)
  * [Nomad Integration with Vault](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/lf9lvmtfpson)
  * [Nomad Enterprise Governance](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/yvqyiphxoc0e)
* If you're fast, you'll also be able to run one of three stateful workload tracks.

???
* This workshop uses labs run in Instruqt

# Nomad Overview

???
* We thought it would be a good idea to repeat the Nomad Overview from the Introduction to Nomad workshop.

# Nomad's Place in the HashiStack
.center[![:scale 80%](images/Nomad_HashiStack_Velocity.png)]

???

* Organizations can use Nomad to run their containerized workloads across any cloud or on premise.

# The Shift to Containers
.center[![:scale 70%](images/Nomad_Business_Value.png)]

???
*  Lowers total cost of ownership (TCO) via bin packing
*  Runs both containerized and legacy apps (e.g. Java classes and jars)
*  Easy to operate and maintain

???
* Companies are embracing containers, but still need to run legacy applications.
* Nomad supports both.

---
name: chapter-intro-nomad-business-value
# Nomad's Business Value
* Increase Hardware Utilization.
  * Increase density of running applications through bin-packing.
* Reduce Operational Overhead.
 * Empower developers to self-service their own applications with less or no assistance from operators.
* Accelerate Time To Market.
  * Run containers and legacy applications together with the same workflow on the same infrastructure.

???
*  Let's discuss the business benefits of Nomad.

---
name:  chapter1-what-is-nomad
# What is Nomad?
* A flexible, lightweight, high performing, easy to use orchestrator
* Used to deploy and manage containers and legacy applications simultaneously
* Works across data centers and cloud platforms, providing universal scheduling
* Manages services, batch functions, as well as global system services

???
* Nomad runs as a single binary in just about any environment * one of the easiest and lightweight service scheduler and manager available.
*  Used to deploy both container applications, as well as legacy applications such as Java or raw executables.
*  As an independent function, Nomad can run and communicate across data centers, and cloud platforms.  Truly cloud agnostic.
*  Can manage individual services, batch functions, or even global system services such as monitoring functions.

???
* Container Workloads
* Legacy Applications
* Batch Jobs like Machine Learning

---
name: chapter-intro-nomad-workload-types
# Run All Types of Workloads
.center[![:scale 100%](images/Nomad-Workload-Types.png)]

???
* Nomad can run these 3 types of workloads

---
name: chapter-intro-nomad-autoscaling
class: compact
# Nomad Autoscaling
* Nomad supports two types of autoscaling:
  * **Horizontal Application Autoscaling** allows the counts of task groups to dynamically scale up and back down.
  * **Horizontal Cluster Autoscaling** allows the size of a Nomad cluster to dynamically scale out and back in.
* The latter is currently only supported in AWS using Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).
* Both types of autoscaling are driven by APM metrics.
* The Nomad Autoscaler agent can be deployed as a Nomad job.

???
* Nomad supports two types of autoscaling:
  * Horizontal application autoscaling
  * Horizontal cluster autoscaling
* The latter is currently only supported in AWS.
* Both reply upon APM metrics such as those from Prometheus.
* The Nomad Autoscaler agent can be deployed as a Nomad job.

---
name: chapter-intro-nomad-federation
# Federation Made Real
.center[![:scale 100%](images/Nomad-Federation.png)]

???
* Nomad can deploy applications seamlessly to federated clusters across multiple clouds.
* It is the first and only orchestrator on the market with complete and fully-supported federation capabilities for production.

* Multi-Update Strategies
* Multi-Region Federation
* Autoscaling
* Container Storage Interface Plugins
* Container Network Interface Plugins
* Access Control System
* Web UI

* Device Plugins allow community members to extend Nomad functionality to other drivers and devices including NVIDIA GPUs for compute-intensive workloads
* Enables various update strategies such as rolling, blue-green and canary
* Nomad Clusters can be federated across multiple cloud regions and on-prem datacenters
* Autoscaling supports horizontal scaling of both applications (changing task group count) and of clusters (changing # of Nomad clients)
* Supports CSI and CNI plugins for maximum flexibility of storage and networking.
* ACLs to control access to data and APIs
* Web UI included out-of-the-box
* Native integration with other HashiCorp products Consul and Vault

# Nomad Enterprise Platform Features
* All Open Source Features
* Automated Upgrades with Autopilot
* Automated Backups with Snapshot Agent
* Enhanced Read Scalability
* Redundancy Zones
* Multiple Vault Namespaces

???
* All Open Source Features are included in Enterprise
* Autopilot Upgrades
* Automated backups with Nomad's Snapshot agent
* Servers can act as a non-voting member of the cluster to help provide read scalability
* Nomad attempts to parition servers according to specified redundancy zone, and will aim to keep one voting server per zone
* A single Nomad cluster can access multiple namespaces of a Vault cluster.

# Nomad Enterprise Modules
* Nomad Enterprise Governance & Policy Module
  * Namespaces
  * Resource Quotas
  * Sentinel Policies
  * Cross-Namespace Queries
  * Audit Logging
* Nomad Multi-Cluster & Efficiency Module
  * Multi-Region Job Deployments

???
* A shared cluster can be partitioned into multiple namespaces which allow jobs and their associated objects to be isolated from each other and other users of the cluster
* Resource quotas limit resource consumption across teams or projects to reduce waste and align budgets
* Sentinel defines policies such as disallowing jobs to be submitted to production on Fridays or only allowing users to run jobs that use pre-authorized Docker images
* Cross-Namespace Queries allow the Nomad HTTP API and CLI to retrieve data from multiple namespaces.
* Audit Logging allows enterprises to proactively identify access anomalies.
* Multi-region Deployments can deploy allocations across multiple Nomad clusters/regions and roll back if deployments fail in remote clusters.
