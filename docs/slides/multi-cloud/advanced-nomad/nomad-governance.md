# Nomad Governance and Policy Features
* Audit Logging
* Namespaces
* Resource Quotas
* Sentinel Policies
* Cross-Namespace Queries

Since Nomad 1.0.0, Namespaces are actually an open source feature, but since they are required by resource quotas, we discuss them in this chapter.

???
* The Nomad Enterprise Governance and Policy module includes Audit Logging, Namespaces, Resource Quotas, Sentinel Policies, and Cross-Namespace Queries.

---
name: nomad-enterprise-audit-logging
# Nomad Enterprise Audit Logging
* Nomad Enterprise's [Audit Logging](https://nomadproject.io/docs/enterprise/#audit-logging) provides Nomad administrators a complete set of records for all user-issued actions in Nomad.
* Nomad Enterprise customers can proactively identify access anomalies, ensure enforcement of their security policies, and diagnose cluster behavior by viewing preceding user operations.
* Each audit event is captured with relevant request and response information in a JSON format that is easily digestibile and familiar to operators.

???
* Let's start with Nomad Enterprise's audit logging that was added in Nomad 0.11.0.

---
name: nomad-namespaces
# Nomad Namespaces
* [Namespaces](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/namespaces) allow multiple teams to safely share a Nomad cluster.
* The jobs and tasks of one namespace are isolated from those of others.
* The namespace of a job is specified by the job's `namespace` stanza.
  * Jobs are run in the `default` namespace if none is specified.
* Nomad's ACL system restricts who can run jobs in namespaces and who can apply resource quotas and Sentinel policies.
* Resource quotas can be applied to namespaces to restrict their consumption of cluster resources.

???
* Nomad Enterprise namespaces allow multiple teams to safely share a Nomad cluster, especially when combined with Nomad Enterprise resource quotas
* Jobs that do not specify a namespace in their job specification are run in the default namespace.

---
name: nomad-namespaces-cli-commands
# Namespace CLI Commands
* Namespaces can be managed with these CLI commands:
  * `namespace list`: List all namespaces.
  * `namespace apply`: Create or update a namespace.
  * `namespace status`: Display the status of a namespace.
  * `namespace inspect`: Inspect extra details of a namespace.
  * `namespace delete`: Delete a namespace.

???
* These are the Nomad CLI commands for managing namespaces.

class: compact
# Selecting a Namespace in the Nomad UI

.center[![:scale 75%](images/Nomad-Default-Namespace.png)]

.center[![:scale 75%](images/Nomad-QA-Namespace.png)]

???
* After creating namespaces and running jobs in them, you can select namespaces in the upper-left corner of the Nomad UI and inspect jobs within them.

---
name: nomad-resource-quotas
# Nomad Enterprise Resource Quotas
* [Resource Quotas](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/quotas) allow Nomad operators to restrict the aggregate resource consumption of namespaces.
* The most common resources restricted are CPU and Memory.
* But it is also possible to restrict network usage

???
* Nomad resource quotas allow Nomad operators to restrict the aggregate resource consumption of namespaces.

---
name: nomad-quota-cli-commands
# Resource Quota CLI Commands
* Resource quotas can be managed with these CLI commands:
  * `quota init`: Create an example resource quota.
  * `quota list`: List all resource quotas.
  * `quota apply`: Create or update a resource quota.
  * `quota status`: Display the status of a resource quota.
  * `quota inspect`: Inspect extra details of a resource quota.
  * `quota delete`: Delete a resource quota.
* A resource quota is attached to a namespace with the command `nomad namespace apply -quota <quota> <namespace>`.

???
* Here are the Nomad CLI commands for working with resource quotas.
---
name: generated-resource-quota
class: smaller, compact
# Resource Quota Generated by Init Command
```hcl
name = "default-quota"
description = "Limit the shared default namespace"

limit {
    region = "global"
    region_limit {
        cpu = 2500
        memory = 1000
        network {
           mbits = 50
        }
    }
}
```

???
* Here is what the `nomad quota init` command generates.
* You can use this as a template for defining your own resource quotas.

---
name: nomad-sentinel-policies
# Nomad Enterprise Sentinel Policies
* [Sentinel Policies](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/sentinel) in Nomad restrict the characteristics of jobs submitted to Nomad.
* Sentinel policies extend and require the Nomad [ACL system](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/access-control).
* Nomad Sentinel policies can do things like:
  * Restrict which drivers are allowed.
  * Restrict which Docker images can be used.
  * Restrict which networks Docker images can use.
  * Restrict total memory used by all the task groups of a job.

???
* Nomad Sentinel policies restrict the characteristics of jobs submitted to Nomad.

---
name: sample-nomad-policy
class: compact, smaller
# Sample Nomad Sentinel Policy
```hcl
# Rule that restricts Nomad drivers
allow_docker_and_java = rule {
  all job.task_groups as tg {
    all tg.tasks as task {
      task.driver in ["docker", "java"]
    }
  }
}

# Main rule
main = rule {
  allow_docker_and_java
}
```

???
* This is a Nomad Sentinel policy that only allows the Docker and Java task drivers to be used.

---
name: nomad-cross-namespace-queries
# Nomad Cross-Namespace Queries
* Nomad Enterprise's [Cross-Namespace Queries](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/enterprise#cross-namespace-queries) allow Nomad operators to query jobs and allocations across all namespaces for faster operator debugging and visibility in multi-tenant clusters.
* This enterprise feature accelerates and simplifies the debugging process by allowing operators to easily locate faulty jobs and allocations from developers.

???
* Finally, let's talk about Nomad Enterprise's cross-namespace queries that were added in Nomad 0.12.0.

---
name: lab-nomad-governance
# üë©‚Äçüíª Nomad Enterprise Governance Lab
* In this lab, you'll learn how to use Nomad Enterprise's governance capabilities including audit logging, namespaces, resource quotas, Sentinel policies, and cross-namespace queries.
* You'll also enable and use Nomad ACLs since these are required in order to use Sentinel in Nomad.
* You'll do this using the Instruqt track [Nomad Enterprise Governance](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/invite/yvqyiphxoc0e).

???
* Now, you can explore Nomad audit logging, namespaces, resource quotas, Sentinel policies, and cross-namespace queries hands-on
* You'll be running the Instruqt track "Nomad Enterprise Governance"

---
name: chapter-Summary
# üìù Chapter Summary

In this chapter you did the following:
* Learned about Nomad Enterprise's governance features including audit logging, namespaces, resource quotas, Sentinel policies, and cross-namespace queries.
* Actually worked with these Nomad features and Nomad ACLs in an Instruqt lab.

???
* You now know a lot more about Nomad Enterprise's governance features than you did yesterday.
