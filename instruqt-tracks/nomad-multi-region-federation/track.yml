title: Nomad Multi-Region Federation
teaser: |
  In this track you will learn how to federate two Nomad clusters and deploy a multi-region job.
description: |-
  Nomad is the first and only orchestrator on the market with complete and fully-supported federation capabilities for production.

  Nomad operates at a regional level and provides first-class support for federation, which enables users to submit jobs or interact with the Nomad HTTP API targeting any region, from any server, even if that server resides in a different region.

  This track will show you how to use Nomad's federation capabilities including multi-region federation and multi-region job deployments. It is based on these two HashiCorp Learn guides:
    * [Multi-Region Federation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/federation)
    * [Multi-Region Deployments](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/multiregion-deployments)

  Note that running multi-region jobs across federated clusters requires Nomad Enterprise.
