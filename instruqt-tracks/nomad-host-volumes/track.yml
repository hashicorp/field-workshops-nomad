  Learn how Nomad host volumes support stateful workloads.
description: |-
  Some Nomad workloads need to persist data that will still be available if the job that runs the workloads are stopped and restarted.

  Nomad supports stateful workloads with 3 different options:
    * [Nomad Host Volumes](https://nomadproject.io/docs/configuration/client/#host_volume-stanza) that are managed by Nomad and can be used with many Nomad task drivers including Docker, Exec, and Java
    * [Docker Volume Drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/#create-a-volumedriver) such as Portworx that are externally managed and can only be used with the Docker task driver
    * [CSI Plugins](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) that are also externally managed but can be used with many Nomad task drivers including Docker, Exec, and Java

  This track will guide you through using Nomad Host Volumes to persist data for a MySQL database. It is based on the [Stateful Workloads with Nomad Host Volumes](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/stateful-workloads-host-volumes) guide.

  Before running this track, we suggest you run the **Nomad Basics** track.
