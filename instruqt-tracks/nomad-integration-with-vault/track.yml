title: Nomad Integration with Vault
teaser: |
  Integrate Nomad and Vault so that applications orchestrated by Nomad can retrieve secrets from Vault.
description: |-
  In this track, you are going to explore how [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) integrates seamlessly with [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) and allows applications orchestrated by Nomad to retrieve secrets from Vault.

  You will use Nomad to deploy a web application that needs to authenticate against a PostgreSQL database in order to display data to the user. Nomad will request dynamic credentials for the database from Vault. The web application will use [Consul's](https://www.consul.io) service discovery capabilities to find the database and use the credentials generated by Vault to connect to it.

  The setup scripts for this track have deployed a VM running Nomad, Consul, and Vault servers and two VMs running Nomad and Consul clients. We are not going to discuss the installation and configuration of Nomad, Consul or Vault apart from the integration of Nomad and Vault.
