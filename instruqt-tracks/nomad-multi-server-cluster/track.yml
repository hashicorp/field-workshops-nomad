title: Nomad Multi-Server Cluster
teaser: |
  Learn how to bootstrap multi-server Nomad clusters in two different ways.
description: |-
  This track will show you how to bootstrap a Nomad cluster that has three servers and two clients in two different ways. You'll first use Nomad's manual clustering and then use automatic clustering with Consul.

  You'll also see how easy it is to register Nomad tasks as Consul services so that they can talk to each other using Consul's service discovery.

  In fact, we'll even use Nomad's integration with [Consul Connect](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/integrations/consul-connect/) to secure the communications between the services!

  Before running this track, we suggest you run the [Nomad Basics](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/nomad-basics) and [Nomad Simple Cluster](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/nomad-simple-cluster) tracks.
