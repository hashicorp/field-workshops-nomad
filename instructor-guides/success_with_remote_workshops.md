## Why Remote?
Some of the advantages of remote training are listed below:

* Save Money - Having your instructor and/or students particpate remotely can save money on travel costs.
* Save Time - Instead of spending time traveling to and from the training facility, users can often dial in from home.
* Support Users in Multiple Locations - Remote workshops enable users to partipate from multiple locations at once.
* Accommodate Travel Restrictions - Sometimes you may be unable to travel due to bad weather disease outbreaks, natural disasters, civil unrest or other situations.

## Disadvantages of Remote
There are also some disadvantages of remote training, which we'll show you how to address in this document.

* Less Personal. A remote teleconference is not as friendly or personal as an in-person meeting.
* Participants lose interest or multitask. Some folks have a hard time learning outside a traditional classroom environment.
* Helping students when they get stuck can be challenging.
* Internet connectivity issues can make a less than ideal experience.
* Audio/Video can be challenging to get set up correctly.

## Types of Remote Workshop
1. All participants on site at the client.
2. All participants remote (working from home or in their cubicle).
3. Some participants in the office, some working from home or desk.

## Plan Your Remote Workshop
Here are the steps you'll need to follow to ensure that your remote workshop is a success:

### All Workshops
☐ Work with your sales rep and customer champion to plan the event in advance.<br>
☐ Ensure that you have read the instructor guide(s) for your workshops.<br>
☐ Make sure that you have at least one teacher's assistant (TA) for every 25 students.<br>
☐ Practice the slide deck and talk track before your workshop.<br>
☐ Send multiple email communications to the prospect/customer to remind them about the event.<br>
☐ In your emails, introduce yourself and remind students about the prerequisites for training.<br>
☐ Make sure you add your workshop to the instruqt-workshops calendar, including the names of the host and presenters and the URLs of all tracks used by it.<br>

### Workshops With On Site Training Rooms
☐ Check the training room and audio-visual setup well in advance of the workshop.<br>
☐ If possible, recruit a faciliator for each room where the customer will have participants.<br>
☐ Devote a laptop for presenting on the customer side. Or if they have Zoom rooms built in even better.<br>
☐ Have your facilitator connect to a test Zoom and make sure your sound and video are crystal clear.<br>
☐ Run an internet speed check from the training wifi network.<br>
☐ Make sure your facilitator can connect successfully to Instruqt from the training room.<br>
☐ For smaller groups, you can optionally have people logged onto zoom from their laptops as well (remember to mute mics!).<br>
☐ For larger groups, have your facilitator relay questions to you from the room.<br>

## Audio/Video
Reliable audio and video are critical for a good training experience. We strongly recommend using a good old fashioned hard-wired Internet connection. Wifi can be flaky and often adds a significant delay to your audio and video stream. If hard wired is not available make sure you have minimum 10 megabit/second stable connection. You can use speedtest.net to check your Internet connection speed: https://www.speedtest.net/

Make sure you have a reliable microphone and headset. The microphone is also super important. Test your mic repeatedly and ask other Zoom users how it sounds. An external USB microphone can be purchased for $10 and might be better than the built in one on your headset.

The same advice goes for your webcam. Don't use the built in pinhole camera on your laptop for a remote training. Get a good Logitech or other camera that is high resolution and high bandwidth. Mount the camera around eye level. If you have an external monitor you can often mount it right on the top of the monitor.

## Zoom meeting or Zoom webinar?
HashiCorp Zoom meetings can accommodate up to 500 participants by default. Zoom Breakout rooms, on the other hand, cap out at 200. If you think you're going to have a workshop larger than 200 attendees, please reach out on Slack in the #se-workshops channel.

## Enabling Break-out Sessions

To enable break-out sessions open your Zoom application and under your profile picture in the top right select the Gear icon.

Select "Advanced Features"

"View Advanced Features" - This will open a webpage

Under Meeting, select In Meeting (Advanced)

Turn on Breakout Room's and select "Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling" (**NOTE THIS WILL DISABLE REMOTE ASSISTANCE**)

## Using Break-Out Sessions In Zoom

Once a Zoom begins, in the menu bezel there should be a new button called "Breakout Rooms"

Select this option and configure your break-out room.

You will recieve a configuration screen in which you can manually or automatically push your participants into break-out rooms.

Once selected you will receieve an additional menu that allows you to manage the break-out rooms and individual participants.


## Tips and Tricks
Start the Zoom at least 10 minutes before the official start time.

Be on time! If you say you're going to start back up in 10 minutes after a break, stick with it. You have a lot of content to present and therefore should not waste time waiting for stragglers. Go over the schedule at the beginning of the workshop. Stick to it.

For small groups you can have everyone introduce themselves individually.

Use a fun Zoom virtual background. Laptops with newer processor can put a virtual background behind you.

Force yourself to look into the camera when you're talking. It feels more personal to the folks on the other side when they see you looking at them. you can make this easier by placing the zoom window right underneath the camera on your screen.

Mute yourself during the labs. Let the students work in silence, but leave the bridge open.

Cover your camera with a sticky note.  This extra layer of protection will save you from potential embarassment. Trust us on this one.

Ask everyone to mute themselves when not talking, or have your TA be the mute police for you with larger groups.

Make sure you have a quiet area with no interruptions where you can present. Don't try to do this from a coffee shop or hotel lobby.

Encourage students to put their questions into text chat. This ensures that questions are captured and not forgotten.

Have your TAs watch the text chat and respond via text if appropriate.

You can answer all the chat questions at the end of each lecture. During labs you'll want to answer questions in real-time.

During the labs, put a timer up on your screen to let students know how much time is left. There lots of free timers on the Internet that you can use, such as this one: https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/

If you find multiple students are confused on a particular point, you can screen share and walk through the solution interactively.

Keep it fun and lively! Tell some jokes, share stories, ask questions. With smaller groups you can use voice chat to discuss and ask questions. With really large trainings, repeat each question in the chat before you answer it.
