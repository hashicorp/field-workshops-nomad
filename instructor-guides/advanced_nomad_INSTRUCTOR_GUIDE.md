# Advanced Nomad - Instructor Guide

This guide will prepare you to deliver a 3/4-day [Advanced Nomad Workshop](https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-nomad/slides/multi-cloud/advanced-nomad/#1). This workshop content is suitable for HashiCorp community members, prospects and customers. The workshop is a combination of lecture slides and hands-on Instruqt labs that introduce users to advanced Nomad OSS features and to Nomad Enterprise. The workshop may be presented in-person, over the web, or as a self-guided tutorial.

Students participating in this workshop should first have completed the [Introduction to Nomad Workshop](https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-nomad/slides/multi-cloud/nomad-oss) which covers introductory Nomad OSS features.

The workshop alternates between lectures with accompanying slides and hands-on lab exercises. New concepts that are introduced in the slides are reinforced in the labs. Participants will learn both the theory and practice of Nomad. As an instructor you should be well familiar with the slide deck and the Instruqt tracks used in the workshop. Go through the course and make sure you understand all of the major concepts and lab exercises.

When possible you should attend a live training session to observe and learn from another instructor. We will also have video recordings of this workshop available soon.

### Prerequisites
Prerequisites are minimal. All that is required to participate in the workshop is a web browser and Internet access. No software needs to be downloaded or installed. Self-contained lab environments run on the [Instruqt](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp) platform, and markdown-based slide decks are published as Github Pages websites.

The Instruqt tracks include terminal tabs that can be used to execute Nomad CLI commands. They also include the Nomad UI and in some cases the Consul UI.

All instructors and TAs from HashiCorp should be sure to register themselves with Instruqt and then post a message in our Slack channel, #proj-instruqt, asking to be added to the HashiCorp organization within Instruqt. This is important since only members of the HashiCorp organization can see the useful "Skip to Challenge" button on challenges of tracks within this organization.

### Scheduling your workshop
Please add all workshops, both public and private, to the shared instruqt-workshops Google calendar as follows:

1. Create a new event on the instruqt-workshops calendar and set the name to the name of your workshop which could match a name being used by Field Marketing if it is public or the name of a specific customer and a product if it is private. **Note that this calendar event should be separate from the one you send to workshop attendees.**
2. Set the begin and end times of the event to the begin and end times of your workshop.
3. Include the following information in the description:
    1. The name of the host (probably yourself) after "Host:"
    2. The names of presenters after "Presenters:"
    3. A list of tracks that your workshop will use after "Tracks:", listing the URL of each track on its own line. **Please do not list links to Instruqt invites.**

Before saving the event, be sure to set the calendar as "instruqt-workshops" instead of your own personal calendar.


### Email Invitation
Here is some boilerplate text you can use or customize when inviting or announcing your workshop:

```
Advanced Nomad
A hands-on technical workshop

This workshop covers advanced Nomad concepts such as controlling job placement, updating jobs, running multi-region jobs across multiple clusters, retrieving secrets from Vault, securing Nomad clusters with ACLs, Nomad autoscaling, and running stateful workloads in Nomad. It also covers Nomad Enterprise platform and governance/policy features including audit logging, namespaces, resource quotas, Sentinel policies, and cross-namespace queries. Join us for a 3/4-day training that expands your Nomad skills beyond what you learned in the Introduction to Nomad workshop (https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-nomad/slides/multi-cloud/nomad-oss).

Topics covered in the workshop include:
* Nomad Job Placement and Variable Interpolation
* Nomad Job Update Strategies
* Nomad Federation and Multi-Region Deployments
* Nomad Integration with Vault Using Templates
* Nomad Security
* The Nomad Autoscaler
* Nomad Enterprise Platform Features
* Nomad Enterprise Governance and Policy Features
* Stateful Nomad Workloads

The only technical prerequisites for this workshop are a web browser and willingness to learn. But you should have completed the Introduction to Nomad workshop first.
```

### Markdown Slide Deck
The slide deck for this training is published here:

#### https://hashicorp.github.io/field-workshops-nomad/slides/multi-cloud/advanced-nomad

#### Navigation
Use the arrow keys (up/down or left/right) to navigate back and forth between slides.

Press the `P` key to enter presenter mode and reveal the speaker notes.

Press the `C` key to pop open an external window that will stay synced with your speaker notes window. This is useful for keeping notes on your laptop while showing the presentation on the projector.

#### RemarkJS
The slide deck for this training is written completely in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) using the [RemarkJS](https://remarkjs.com/#1) framework. This allows us to publish slide decks from a source code repository. The slide deck is easy to maintain, lightweight, and can be accessed from anywhere. Updates and changes to the deck can be made quickly and efficiently by simply editing the markdown source files. If you find any mistakes or issues with the slides please add them to our issue tracker:

https://github.com/hashicorp/field-workshops-nomad/issues

### Hands-on Labs
At certain points in the slide deck there are references to the lab exercises. [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/hashicorp) is our lab platform. You will need to provide a link to an invite that includes these tracks as described below.

Participants can register with Instruqt [here](https://play.instruqt.com/signup). They can then login via email, Google, GitHub, and Twitter.

Students may have questions during the labs. When presenting a workshop be sure to give enough time for all your participants to go through the labs. Remember that this is probably their first time using a tool like Nomad.

As mentioned in the Prerequisites section, all HashiCorp instructors and TAs for workshops should register with Instruqt and then post a message in our Slack channel, #proj-instruqt, asking to be added to the HashiCorp organization in Instruqt.

Members of the HashiCorp organization in Instruqt can hover over any challenge in any track in that organization and see a "Skip to Challenge" button. After starting a track, you can use these buttons to run the track's setup and solve scripts up to the challenge you want to skip to. When skipping to a challenge, always be sure to click the "Normal Skip" button too.

#### Primary Instruqt Tracks
The following tracks are the primary Instruqt tracks used in the Advanced Nomad Workshop:

8. Make the track available to your user for 1 month.
9. Do not enable the **Allow anonymous** setting if you want to be able to track which users played the track based on their emails.


### Configuring the Instruqt Pools
We recommend that you configure Instruqt pools for each Instruqt track used in this workshop 1 hour before you plan to use the track. Please see this Confluence [doc](https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/511574174/Instruqt+and+Remark+Contributor+Guide#InstruqtandRemarkContributorGuide-ConfiguringInstruqtPools) for instructions.

### Timing
You should budget about 5.5 hours for this workshop including two short breaks. This is meant as a guideline, you can adjust as needed.
